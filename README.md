# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction 

This repository contains EDA and prediction of present/absent cases of Cardiovascular disease in patients using various classification models to get the optimum accuracy for prediction.


## Why this Project?

According to the National Institute of Health, United States, there has been a steady rise in deaths and disability arising from cardiovascular disease over the last 30 years. In 2019 alone, the condition, which includes heart disease and stroke, was responsible for a staggering one-third of all deaths worldwide. This prompted my motive to contribute in this project.
